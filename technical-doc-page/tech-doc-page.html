            Although this tutorial doesn't use this approach, many React
            applications define their styles on a per-component basis, rather
            than in a single, monolithic stylesheet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code class="inline-cd">create-react-app</code> makes it possible to
            import CSS files into JavaScript modules, so that CSS is only sent
            to your user when the corresponding component is rendered. For this
            app, we could have for example written a dedicated
            <code class="inline-cd">Form.css</code> file to house the styles of
            those respective components, then imported the styles into their
            respective modules like this:
          </p>
          <div class="code-example">
            <code
              >import Form from "./Form";<br />
              import "./Form.css";
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            This approach makes it easy to identify and manage the CSS that
            belongs to a specific component. However, it also fragments your
            stylesheet across your codebase, and this fragmentation might not be
            worthwhile. For larger applications with hundreds of unique views
            and lots of moving parts, it makes sense to limit the amount of
            irrelevant code that's sent to your user. You'll likely have
            app-wide styles and specific component styles that build on top of
            those.

            We used <code class="inline-cd">console.log()</code> to check on the
            state and props of our application in this tutorial, and you'll also
            have seen some of the useful warnings and error message that React
            gives you both in the CLI and your browser's JavaScript console. But
            there's more we can do here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The React DevTools utility allows you to inspect the internals of
            your React application directly in the browser. It adds a new panel
            to your browser's developer tools, and with it you can inspect the
            state and props of various components, and even edit state and props
            to make immediate changes to your application.
          </p>
          <p>
            This screenshot shows our finished application as it appears in
            React DevTools:

            On the left, we see all of the components that make up our
            application, including some unique keys for the things that are
            rendered from arrays. On the right, we see the props and hooks that
            our App component utilizes. Notice, too, that the
            <code class="inline-cd">Form</code>,
            <code class="inline-cd">FilterButton</code>, and
            <code class="inline-cd">Todo</code> components are indented to the
            right - this indicates that <code class="inline-cd">App</code> is
            their parent. In more complex apps, this view is great for
            understanding parent/child relationships at a glance.

            The application that we built in this tutorial utilized component
            props to pass data from its
            <code class="inline-cd">App</code> component to the child components
            that needed it. Most of the time, props are an appropriate method
            for sharing data; for complex, deeply nested applications, however,
            they're not always best.

            Although this tutorial doesn't mention them, it is possible to build
            React components using classes - these are called class components.
            Until the arrival of hooks, classes were the only way to bring state
            into components or manage rendering side effects. They're still the
            only way to handle certain other, more edge-case features, and
            they're very common in legacy React projects. The official React
            docs are a great place to start learning about them.

            integration, and end-to-end testing of React components and
            applications. It works more directly with DOM nodes, and therefore
            it's recommended to use with
            <code class="inline-cd">jest-dom</code>
            for improved assertions.

        <header>Routing</header>
        <div class="section-details">
          <p>
            While routing is traditionally handled by a server and not an
            application on the user's computer, it is possible to configure a
            web application to read and update the browser's location, and
            render certain user interfaces. This is called client-side routing.
            It's possible to create many unique routes for your application
            (such as
            <code class="inline-cd">/home</code>,
            <code class="inline-cd">/dashboard</code>, or
            <code class="inline-cd">login/</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The React community has produced two major libraries for client-side
            routing:
            <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main" target="_blank"
              >React Router</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://reach.tech/router/" target="_blank">Reach Router</a
            >.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              React Router is well-suited to applications with complex routing
              needs, and it meets some edge cases better than Reach Router.
              React Router is a larger library, however.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reach Router is well-suited to simpler applications, and
              automatically manages focus as the user navigates from page to
              page.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To install <code class="inline-cd">React-router</code>, you can run:
          </p>
          <div class="code-example">
            <code>npm i react-router;</code>
          </div>
          <p>Or if you use yarn, you can install with this:</p>
          <div class="code-example">
            <code>yarn add react-router;</code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Focus management is essential in client-side routing — without it,
            keyboard users can be trapped in focus limbo, and screen-reader
            users may have no idea that they have moved to a new page. Because
            Reach Router is better for accessibility, it's a good place to
            start.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's one caveat, however: these projects will be

            Reach).
